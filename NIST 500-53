NIST 800-53 : special publication 
<Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations> 

Purpose : Provide guidelines and Best practices for protecting Government's sensitive information and PII of Citizens against cyber attacks.

- this special publication is auhtored by the Joint Task Force.

In combination with NIST 800-53 - SP 800-37 Rev2 was introduced.
 - 800-37 Rev2 included RMF - Risk Management Framework.
 
 : which helps identify a risk-based approach for using and storing PII, because all data is not equal and is necessary.
 SP 800-37 should be used in CONJUNCTION with the SP800-53 
  -- Adds privacy consideration into the design as well as information on how to improve controls for diverse industry groups from public and private sectors to individuals.
 
 The major changes to the (SP) 800-53 Rev 5 are:

Making the security and privacy controls more outcome-based by changing the structure of the controls;
Fully integrating the privacy controls into the security control catalog creating a consolidated and unified set of controls for information systems and organizations, while providing summary and mapping tables for privacy-related controls;
Separating the control selection process from the actual controls, thus allowing the controls to be used by different communities of interest including systems engineers, software developers, enterprise architects; and mission/business owners;
Promoting integration with different risk management and cyber security approaches and lexicons, including the Cyber Security Framework;
Clarifying the relationship between security and privacy to improve the selection of controls necessary to address the full scope of security and privacy risks; and
Incorporating new, state-of-the-practice controls based on threat intelligence and empirical attack data, including controls to strengthen cyber security and privacy governance and accountability.


The NIST (SP) 800-53 combined with the (SP) 800-37 establishes a multi-tiered risk approach:

Tier 1 – The Organization

Tier 2 – The Mission Critical or Business Processes

Tier 3 – Information Systems

The main goal is of the organization is to identify a risk-based approach to the information systems that are vital to the operations and continuous service of the organization or agency.

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK – Security Life Cycle

The starting point is to follow a 6-step process known as the Security Life Cycle which is as follows, with associated Publication References:

Step 1 – CATAGORIZE Information Systems (FIPS 199/SP 800-60) – IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Step 2 – SELECT Security Controls (FIPS 200/SP 800-53)

Step 3 – IMPLEMENT Security Controls (SP 800-160)

Step 4 – ASSESS Security Controls (SP 800-53A)

Step 5 – AUTHORIZE Information Systems (SP 800-37)

Step 6 – MONITOR Security Controls (SP 800-137) 

The NIST 800-53 is broken into the minimum security controls IMPACT baseline adapted from the FIPS 200 which are:

Low-Impact
Moderate-Impact
High-Impact



The TRUST MODEL

A trust model is referenced within NIST 800-53 which is used to determine the trustworthiness of systems and components based on 
their ability to meet security requirements, security capabilities, and security functionality along with security assurance based on
evidence.  This is an area which is growing in importance and is about establishing a trust-based approach and how much risk 
is acceptable based on the trustworthiness of systems and components will determine how much access they will have.


The TAILORING GUIDEANCE

Because all risks are not equal the NIST 800-53 provides tailoring guidance (based on the input from the Initial Security Control Impact Baseline referred to earlier) which, when aligned with the assessment of the organizational risks enables the security controls to be tailored to the acceptable risk.

These guidelines follow the steps below:

Identifying and Designating Common Controls
Applying Scoping Considerations
Selecting Compensating Controls
Assigning Security Control Parameter Values
Supplementing Baseline Security Controls
Providing Additional Specification Information for Implementation
During this process full documentation of the security controls decisions must be agreed upon and maintained to ensure adequate security and protection.

The NIST 800-53 and PRIVILEGED ACCESS

Now, let’s focus on the NIST 800-53 guidelines for privileged access which is referenced in multiple security control identifiers and families.  The main area under Access Controls refers to using a Least Privilege approach in conjunction with Least Functionality. This is considered high-impact and 
requires giving the users or system only the minimum access required to fulfill the role or function and nothing more.
