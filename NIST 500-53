NIST - National Institute of Standards and Technology 

- Sets standards, Guidelines and Recommended security controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.

Extensive Database of Publications includes

- FIPS : Federal Information Processing Standards
- SP   : NIST Special Publications
- NISTIR : NIST Internal Reports
- ITL Bulletin : NIST Information Technology Laboratory Bulletins

NIST 800-53 : special publication 
<Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations> 

Purpose : Provide guidelines and Best practices for protecting Government's sensitive information and PII of Citizens against cyber attacks.

- this special publication is auhtored by the Joint Task Force.

In combination with NIST 800-53 - SP 800-37 Rev2 was introduced.
 - 800-37 Rev2 included RMF - Risk Management Framework.
 
 : which helps identify a risk-based approach for using and storing PII, because all data is not equal and is necessary.
 SP 800-37 should be used in CONJUNCTION with the SP800-53 
  -- Adds privacy consideration into the design as well as information on how to improve controls for diverse industry groups from public and private sectors to individuals.
 
 The major changes to the (SP) 800-53 Rev 5 are:

Making the security and privacy controls more outcome-based by changing the structure of the controls;
Fully integrating the privacy controls into the security control catalog creating a consolidated and unified set of controls for information systems and organizations, while providing summary and mapping tables for privacy-related controls;
Separating the control selection process from the actual controls, thus allowing the controls to be used by different communities of interest including systems engineers, software developers, enterprise architects; and mission/business owners;
Promoting integration with different risk management and cyber security approaches and lexicons, including the Cyber Security Framework;
Clarifying the relationship between security and privacy to improve the selection of controls necessary to address the full scope of security and privacy risks; and
Incorporating new, state-of-the-practice controls based on threat intelligence and empirical attack data, including controls to strengthen cyber security and privacy governance and accountability.


The NIST (SP) 800-53 combined with the (SP) 800-37 establishes a multi-tiered risk approach:

Tier 1 – The Organization

Tier 2 – The Mission Critical or Business Processes

Tier 3 – Information Systems

The main goal is of the organization is to identify a risk-based approach to the information systems that are vital to the operations and continuous service of the organization or agency.

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK – Security Life Cycle

The starting point is to follow a 6-step process known as the Security Life Cycle which is as follows, with associated Publication References:

Step 1 – CATAGORIZE Information Systems (FIPS 199/SP 800-60) – IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Step 2 – SELECT Security Controls (FIPS 200/SP 800-53)

Step 3 – IMPLEMENT Security Controls (SP 800-160)

Step 4 – ASSESS Security Controls (SP 800-53A)

Step 5 – AUTHORIZE Information Systems (SP 800-37)

Step 6 – MONITOR Security Controls (SP 800-137) 

The NIST 800-53 is broken into the minimum security controls IMPACT baseline adapted from the FIPS 200 which are:

Low-Impact
Moderate-Impact
High-Impact
